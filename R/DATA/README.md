## DATA 

``DS1_run_1.trees`` is the a set of 10 000  trees (chain length = 10 million iterations) sampled with BEAST from the [DS1](http://treebase.org/treebase-web/search/downloadANexusFile.html?id=362&matrixid=2017) data set in [Whidden & Matsen (2015)](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/01/27/sysbio.syv006.abstract ). I used a HKY85 model with gamma site-rate heterogeneity and a constant population coalescent prior. 

``DS1_run_1.tree`` the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree from the run above, with no burn in.

``Dengue4.env.trees`` holds the 10 0000 trees sampled with BEAST using a HKY model with gamma site-rate heterogeneity and a [Skygrid](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/12/17/molbev.mss265.full) coalescent prior.

``Dengue4.env_mcc.tree`` is the  MCC tree annotated from this run, with no burn in.
